| Configuration | Option 1 | Option 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bottom row | 6.25U - JP1, JP5 | 7U - JP2, JP6 |
| Backspace | Split - JP3 | Full - JP4 |
| Right Shift | Normal Split - JP8, JP10 | Arrows - JP7, JP9 |

In the image below, JP10 and JP8 are soldered together for a "normal right shift split".
